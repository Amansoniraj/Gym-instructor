        <p class="sectionTag text-big">The littel info about the Weight training</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Weight training is a type of strength training that uses weights for resistance. Weight training provides a stress to the muscles that causes them to adapt and get stronger, similar to the way aerobic conditioning strengthens your heart.
        Weight training can be performed with free weights, such as barbells and dumbbells, or byusing weight machines. You can also increase your strength through other types of resistanceexercises, such as by using your body weight or resistance bands.
        You don't have to be in the weight room for 90 minutes a day to see results. For most people, short weight training sessions a couple of times a week are more practical than are extended daily workouts.
        You can see significant improvement in your strength with just two or three 20- or 30-minute weight training sessions a week. That frequency also meets activity recommendations for healthy adults.
        The Department of Health and Human Services recommends incorporating strength training exercises of all the major muscle groups into a fitness routine at least two times a week.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">The idea of Why We do Cardio</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Cardio exercise, which is sometimes referred to as aerobic exercise, is any rhythmic activity that raises your heart rate into your target heart rate zone. This is the zone where you burn the most fat and calories.Part of what sets cardio apart from other types of exercise—such as strength training—is that it relies on your body's ability to use oxygen during the workout session. A person's cardio ability or capacity can vary based on a number of factors.Research published by the American Heart Association reports that genetics have a 20% to 40% influence over what you can do cardio-wise.1 Also, females tend to have a 25% lower cardio capacity than males and, for both sexes, this capacity tends to decline with age.</p>
